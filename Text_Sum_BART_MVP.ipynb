        "This project delivers a working prototype of an AI-powered dialogue summarization tool using a fine-tuned BART transformer model. Trained on the SAMSum dataset, the model achieves ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores above 0.40, producing clear, concise summaries of group chats. This solution helps users catch up faster on conversations, reducing information overload and improving engagement on the platform.\n",

        "In this project, I built an end-to-end dialogue summarization pipeline using the SAMSum dataset. The goal was to create a working prototype that helps users quickly catch up on group chats by generating concise, fluent summaries. I followed a full modeling pipeline, from data exploration to inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, I attempted to build a custom encoder–decoder model using DistilBERT and GPT‑2. While conceptually valid, this setup introduced versioning issues and decoding errors with **Trainer** under Python 3.12. I also faced compute limitations locally, so I transitioned the training process to Google Colab to take advantage of GPU support. After troubleshooting for several days, I pivoted to a more stable and efficient architecture: **facebook/bart-base**, which combines encoder and decoder in one and is pre-trained for summarization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final model was fine-tuned on tokenized dialogue–summary pairs and evaluated using both ROUGE metrics and qualitative review. It achieved strong scores on the validation set: ROUGE-1: 51.61, ROUGE-2: 27.22, ROUGE-L: 43.04. \n",
        "\n",
        "The model also performed well in real-world inference tests, generating fluent summaries that closely matched human references in tone and content.\n",
        "\n",
        "###  Possible Improvements:\n",
        "- Train longer or with larger batches to further improve scores\n",
        "- Try alternative models like T5 or BART-large\n",
        "- Add human evaluation for deeper quality analysis\n",
        "- Package the model for deployment as an API or interface\n",
        "\n",
        "This project shows that transformer-based summarization is both technically feasible and practically useful for reducing information overload in messaging apps. It lays a strong foundation for future feature development at platforms like Acme Communications.\n"
